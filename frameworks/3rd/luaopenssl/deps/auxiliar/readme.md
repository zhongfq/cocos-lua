# lua-auxiliar

## Introduce

The origin auxiliar is part of [luasocket](https://github.com/diegonehab/luasocket), it's a general purpose class implemention lib for userdata with metatable.

```
/*=========================================================================*\
* Auxiliar routines for class hierarchy manipulation
* LuaSocket toolkit (but completely independent of other LuaSocket modules)
*
* A LuaSocket class is a name associated with Lua metatables. A LuaSocket
* group is a name associated with a class. A class can belong to any number
* of groups. This module provides the functionality to:
*
*   - create new classes
*   - add classes to groups
*   - set the class of objects
*   - check if an object belongs to a given class or group
*   - get the userdata associated to objects
*   - print objects in a pretty way
*
* LuaSocket class names follow the convention <module>{<class>}. Modules
* can define any number of classes and groups. The module tcp.c, for
* example, defines the classes tcp{master}, tcp{client} and tcp{server} and
* the groups tcp{client,server} and tcp{any}. Module functions can then
* perform type-checking on their arguments by either class or group.
*
* LuaSocket metatables define the __index metamethod as being a table. This
* table has one field for each method supported by the class, and a field
* "class" with the class name.
*
* The mapping from class name to the corresponding metatable and the
* reverse mapping are done using lauxlib.

## Update

I do minimual change, and add a few APIs for [lui](https://github.com/zhaozg/lui) and [lua-openssl](https://github.com/zhaozg/lua-openssl).
TODO more
